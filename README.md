Mars Weather App React - data was provided by NASA Rest API.
Unfortunately due to dust falling on solar batteries and therefore lack of energy, InSight has suspended daily temperature measurements.

I decided to leave this repostory because it was great fun to learn making this app and the most of all very good job.

I used create-react-app with styled-components.

App made with substantial inspiration from may great teachers: Kevin Powell, Web Dev Simplified, Weibenfalk.
Thank You!

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
